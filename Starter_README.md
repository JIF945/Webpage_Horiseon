# Webpage_Horiseon
the code on Webpage_Horiseon was not the cleanest clearest or best it can be. thw website did not meet accessibility standards
I restructured the computer code without changing or adding to its external behavior and Functionality. 
Non semantic elements have been replaced with Semantic elements such as
Header, Nav, section, article, aside, footer. using semantic elements improves functionality and reduces the technical debt if a website.
Alt elements were added to the images, for people that use screen readers. 
after refactor, the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning,
Css is condensed for accessibility. 
The title is concise, descriptive.
